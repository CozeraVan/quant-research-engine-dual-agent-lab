## Implementation Summary

1. **Semantics (locked, batch-path model)**: anchor starts at actual fill `entry_price`, updates every bar while holding with the bar's `high` (fallback to `mark_price_column` when `high` unavailable); trigger when `close <= anchor × (1 - trailing_stop_pct)` → sell next bar open, reason `trailing_stop`. Precedence: pending retry > holding expiry > stop_loss > take_profit > trailing_stop > exit_signal. Deliberate difference from the shared engine (intraday low/high touch + same-day fill) — documented.
2. **Simulator** (`single_symbol.py`): `trailing_stop_pct` field; `trailing_anchor` state (set on fill, updated per bar, reset on exit); trigger branch at locked precedence.
3. **Vectorized engine**: identical anchor/branch; dense candidate set when ANY stop type enabled (fixed or trailing); `high` column array with close fallback.
4. **Wiring**: `BatchBacktestRequest.trailing_stop_pct` + validation (>0); both batch paths thread it; `ResearchRunRequest.trailing_stop_pct` override (None = spec value when `apply_stops`); runner `--trailing-stop-pct`; batch_summary config echo. Shared-mode passthrough was already wired in M10.2b and now uses the hoisted value.
5. **Tests** (5 new deterministic + randomized suite extended with trailing params): trigger with hand-computed anchor/exit, anchor reset between trades, high-column fallback, precedence vs exit_signal (reconstructed after the first data design let exit_signal preempt — documented), batch validation.

## Files Changed

- `src/quant_research_engine/portfolio/single_symbol.py`, `single_symbol_vectorized.py` (anchor + branch)
- `src/quant_research_engine/portfolio/batch.py` (field + validation + threading)
- `src/quant_research_engine/orchestration/research_run.py`, `batch_runner.py`, `scripts/batch_backtest_runner.py` (override + flag)
- `tests/test_single_symbol_vectorized.py` (+5 deterministic, randomized suite now includes trailing)

## Validation Output

```bash
uv run pytest -q → 1134 passed, 4 warnings (1129 baseline + 5 new)

# R-QRE-009 real-DB small-sample:
#   mr04a × 3 codes × smoke, --apply-stops --trailing-stop-pct 0.05:
#     simulator vs vectorized → summary.csv IDENTICAL
#   A/B (1% trailing vs off): summaries differ — trailing measurably honored
#   real trailing_stop exit observed (000001.SZ)
```
