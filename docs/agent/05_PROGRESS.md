## Latest Verified State

Recorded on 2026-05-18 after Codex review of `QRE-REPORT-MANIFEST-SCHEMA-VERSION-001`:

- `uv run pytest tests/test_portfolio_io.py tests/test_portfolio_report_manifest.py -q` -> `14 passed in 0.59s`
- `uv run pytest -q` -> `176 passed in 1.47s`
- `scripts/check-progress-docs.sh` -> passed
- `git diff --check` -> passed
- Review passed with no Required Fixes. Awaiting local checkpoint.

## Completed Module Summary

- Data layer: read-only PostgreSQL adapter, factor catalog, research assembler, metadata fallback, benchmark-bar skeleton, preflight.
- Evaluation layer: safe expression signals, forward returns, event summaries, IC, Rank IC, quantile summaries, rough friction adjustment.
- Portfolio layer: single-symbol, batch, shared-cash, costs, slippage, lot sizing, price-limit checks, risk exits, rebalance, FIFO lot accounting, T+1 sellability, failed-order diagnostics, analytics.
- Reporting: CSV/JSON/Markdown outputs, report manifests, manifest filtering, existence/content validation, strict audit/report-files matching, failed-order artifact schema validation, JSON audit/file-selection output, README documentation, manifest schema versioning.

## Pending Work Summary

- Real index benchmark wiring after table/schema confirmation.
- Real suspension/ST/risk-warning time-varying metadata.
- Industry, board, market-cap, liquidity, membership, and regime grouping.
- Evaluation benchmark/random-baseline comparison.
- Larger research-run reproducibility workflow.

## Status Meaning

- TODO: Not started
- WAITING_USER_APPROVAL: User approval required before the next agent proceeds
- IN_PROGRESS: Started but not complete
- IMPLEMENTED: Implemented by Claude Code, awaiting Codex review
- DONE: Completed and verified or preserved from legacy evidence
- BLOCKED: Blocked
- FUTURE: Future milestone

## Update Rules

- Mark DONE only with evidence.
- If code changed, update `04_TASK_HANDOFF.md` and this file.
- If a dual-agent phase changed, update `11_AGENT_STATE.md`.
- If architecture or major decisions changed, update `06_DECISION_LOG.md`.
