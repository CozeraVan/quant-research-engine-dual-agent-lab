### Initial: Use dual-agent workflow

- Decision: This project uses Codex as Planner/Reviewer/Git Finalizer and Claude Code as Implementer.
- Reason: This separates planning, implementation, review, and final git operations.
- Alternatives: Single-agent coding; manual-only workflow.
- Impact: All tasks should pass through `08_IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md`, `09_CODING_HANDOFF.md`, `10_REVIEW_REPORT.md`, and `11_AGENT_STATE.md`.
